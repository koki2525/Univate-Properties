                        Owning a timeshare means you own a portion of time in a specific unit in a resort. Most commonly the increments are sold per week and usually this means Friday to Friday depending on the specific resorts calendar. In specific resorts it could also mean midweek or weekend modules.

                        Most timeshare resorts are self-catering which means you have a ‘home away from home” holiday. You will not be required to pay for your accommodation week other than a maintenance levy which is charged by the resort. Some resorts do charge a key or breakage deposit but these are usually refundable.

                        Both are equally viable. The difference is either the seller is the developer of a resort marketing directly to the public and offering finance options on the purchase, or an individual who wants to sell their week for a variety of reasons. Often when purchasing from an individual the price can be negotiated as it is a cash sale with no financing options.
